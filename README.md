# Crystal Collector Game
# Created and maintained by Desiree Howell

Brief Overview: At the start of the Crystal Collector game, the user is given a random number (19-120) and each of the four crystals are also assigned a random number (1-12). The goal of the game is to match your score to the given random number by clicking on the four crystals. Each time a crystal is clicked, the value of that crystal is added to the user's score. You lose the game if your score goes over the random number, and you win the game if your score exactly matches the random number.

Game Features: JQuery, keeps track of wins and loses, score div updates when crystals are clicked on, and a reset button to reset the game completely with a new random number and new crystal values.
